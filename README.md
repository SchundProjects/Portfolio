# Student Performance Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of the student performance analysis project is to compare different students in different schools in the US based on how they perform in academics, how active they are in extracurricular activities, and their GPAs in school. While excel was used to edit the dataset downloaded from Kaggle, most of the work was done in SQL in order to edit the database into different tables using operations like inserting new data tables and deleting old data tables and compare the numbers on academics and GPAs to one another. 

### Problem Description

Today, we see how students are busy with what's happening in their schools. While they have their strong points in areas like certain courses, they sometimes don't make a big impact on their GPA and also don't spend enough time outside of their courses. Same can happen the other way around. This analysis comapres these factors to give an idea to students on where they are excelling and where they are lacking so later on they will learn how to balance multiple aspects of school.

### Dataset Information

The foundation of this project is "Student_performance_data_", a dataset curated from Kaggle but downloaded to Excel before converting the whole dataset to SQL.

- **GPA:** The Grade Point Average of students in their courses
- **StudyTimeWeekly:** The frequency of students spend studying outside school
- **Absenses:** The frequency of students missing school
- **Tutoring:** The frequency of students going to tutoring
- **Extracurricular:** The frequency of students participating in extracurricular clubs
  

### Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection:** Aquire and process the dataset "Student_performance_data_" using Kaggle and Excel, executing data integration and reviewing columns with now value.

2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Looking into the dataset to see correlations and trends of the dataset variables

3. **Comparative Analysis:** Comparing the variables to identify similarities and differences between the entities and varibles through upward and downward trends


### Conclusion

The **Student Performance Analysis** Project aims to provide insight to students on their progress by factoring in multiple variables to reflect on where their strengths lie in and where they are lacking.
