I have built a project based on student performance data using Microsoft Excel and SQL. 

The purpose of the student performance data project is to compare different students in different schools in the US based on how they perform in academics, how active they are in extracurricular activities, and their GPAs in school

While excel was used to edit the dataset downloaded from Kaggle, most of the work was done in SQL in order to edit the database into different tables using operations like inserting data and deleting old data and compare the numbers on academics and GPAs to one another.
